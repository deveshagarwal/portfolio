  "bio": "I'm fundamentally a curious person. Which means I'm usually obsessed with something mildly unreasonable. Last month it might've been <a href=\"https://makerworld.com/en/models/13031-blank-elephant#profileId-15158\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" style=\"color: #93c5fd;\" class=\"hover:text-blue-200 transition-colors\">3-D printing tiny elephants</a>. Next month it could be 1960s Japanese cinema. There are no guarantees.\n\nBy day, I work at a <a href=\"https://www.thumbtack.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" style=\"color: #93c5fd;\" class=\"hover:text-blue-200 transition-colors\">marketplace</a> building AI systems that can help you find a plumber. By night, I write, I watch film, I play squash, I thrift, and I disappear into fiction. I'm deeply fascinated by storytelling - how it shapes us, how it tricks us, how it lingers.\n\nThis is my small corner of the internet. I intend it to be a living journal of things currently rearranging in my brain. If something here resonates, please reach out! If not, you can always <a href=\"https://lichess.org/@/devesh_d4\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" style=\"color: #93c5fd;\" class=\"hover:text-blue-200 transition-colors\">challenge me to a game of chess</a>.",
