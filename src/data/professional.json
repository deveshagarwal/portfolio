  "intro": "I spend my days building systems that make marketplaces smarter. Currently, I'm working on AI agents that simulate how buyers and sellers interact, trying to predict ripple effects before they happen. It's the kind of problem that sits at the intersection of economics, machine learning, and a bit of controlled chaos.",
